# SS14-Medical-Suggestions

## Add a personnal medical history (most is already in the game as "Family Medical History", customization screen). 
1) Some combination of this and prescriptions will define symptoms that can occur to patients if they don't take their meds regularly. For example betablockers that can be prescribed for 3 underlying common conditions. 
2) Some of these have no impact ingame except for RP reasons.
---------------------------------------
	Anemia : Bloodloss damage increased, or blood regen lowered?
	Arthritis :  pain
	Asthma : Beta-blockers given to asthmatic patients will cause asphyxiation damage.
	Autoimmune disorder : RP, no gameplay value
	Blood clots : Requires blood thinners.
	Cancer : RP, no gameplay value.
	Chronic pain : pain.
	Depression : Requires antidepressants.
	Diabetes : No gameplay value to begin with. Would require more work: add sweetness level to meals, and blood sugar level to HealthAnalyzer. If meds are not taken after eating something sweet, blood sugar rises and puts the player into a coma after a treshold. Requires IV insulin in medbay to treat. 
	Heart disease : rename to chronic heart failure
	High blood pressure : Add something to measure it ingame? Or just show on HealthAnalyzer? 120/75 mmHg is a normal value
	HIV : RP, no gameplay value, syringes could eventually contaminate people...
	Kidney disease: RP, no gameplay value (would need significant rework of medical and blood filtration mechanics). Maybe just lower the treshold for drug overdose as aren't peed out as fast as usual? 
	Liver disease : RP, no gameplay value.
	Lung disease (Remove? Asthma already there, keep things simple)
	Migraines : Requires betablockers.
	Neuroaversion  : not something medical, remove?
	Osteoporosis : RP, no gameplay value.
	Seizures : Rename to Epilepsy, requires antiepileptics.
	Sleep Apnea : Gives higher blood pressure.
	Stroke : Requires blood thinners or might happen again. 
	
## Prescriptions, most are already in the game (customization screen):
---------------------------------------
	Antiacids
	Anti-anxiety Medication : rename to Anxiolytics
	Antiarrhythmics
	Anticonvulsivants
	Antidepressants
	Antiepileptics
	Antihistamines
	Antihyperetnsive (New)
	Antipsychotics
	Beta-blockers (Do not give to patient with asthma, it would deal asphyxiation damages)
	Blood thinners (Do not give to someone already bleeding! Makes bleeding 2 times faster)
	Hormones (remove? idk what use case for SS14)
	Immunosuppressives (To remove maybe? see below for consequences if you don't take them)
	Painkillers
	Sleeping pills (should not be carried during the shift as you don't sleep during daytime, it could look suspicious based on the context, unless you're heading to a consultation where the doc will ask your medical history, or to pharmacy, or other reasons!)
	
1) A limit should be set for gameplay reasons.

2) Patients should take their meds regularly if prescribed. Otherwise, their condition may worsen:
---------------------------------------
	Antiacids : Start burping if not taken, burning pain emote on the chest especially after eating. Solved by taking pills.
	Anxiolytics : Start stuttering or shaking, might occasionnaly get a panic attack and stay frozen for a few sec. Solved by taking pills.
	Antiarrhythmics : Occasional text "you feel irregular heartbeats...". Rarely, tachycardia with weakness and very fast irregular heartbeats showing on HealthAnalyzer (arrhythmia). Needs fast IV treatment to cure. Leads to cardiac arrest (death with asphyxia damage) if left untreated too long.
	Anticonvulsivants : Use only for seizures (see below). Use antiepileptics to prevent seizures in the long run. 
	Antidepressants : Starts crying often, *sighs* a lot. Solved by taking pills.
	Antiepileptics: Seizures might appear if not taken. Player shaking on the floor for up to a minute. 
	Antihistamines : Allergies might appear, skin rash on health Analyzer, *itches* a lot, *sneezes* a lot, pain. Solved by taking pills.
	Antipsychotics : Might start seeing monsters instead of characters, hear weird noises or voices. Solved by taking pills.
	Beta-blockers : Depends on what's in the medical history: Acute Heart failure = oedema, shortness of breath, can't run. Migraines. Essential tremor, shakey hands and drop items on the ground regularly. 
	Blood thinners : Stroke = Symptoms can be one or multiple between not able to use a hand, standing on feet (1 limb paralysis), everything heard or spoken appears as gibberish (aphasia), one side of the vision is gone either left or right side of the game screen (hemianopia) See below for picture. 
	Hormones : idk yet
	Immunosuppressives : organ failure. Player should spawn and know this otherwise it will be roundbreaking for them. How to show them this info? Or simply remove this?
	Painkillers : pain
	Sleeping pills : nothing gameplaywise as we don't sleep during shifts. Could be used by antags. 
3) "Take meds regularly" should be set to a an amount but I don't know yet. 30 min ingame? How to keep track of time ingame?

4) Meds should be pills of various colors. Some should be IV for the most severe cases and need to be done administered by someone else in medbay. See below for new IV drugs.

5) Instead of family medical history (useless gameplay wise, but good for RP?), maybe change to personal medical history. The history and prescription combination will define the consequences if the treatment is not taken. For example, beta-blockers have 3 usual indications:
* If patient has migraines history, not taken betablockers will lead to headaches. Solved by taking pills.
* If patient has chronic heart failure history, not taking them will lead to acute heart failure. Use IV drug (Furosemide) to cure. 
* If patient has essential tremor history (New), not taking them leads to hands shaking and dropping items on the floor regularly. Solved by taking pills.

6) Some players should spawn without their meds (Patients often cannot get an appointment fast enough to renew them, or forget them when travelling). This would lead to more early round gameplay for doctors, with a few patients coming in to renew their prescriptions (RP).

7) All of the above extends the medical gameplay on what has already been put in the customization screen, but is unique compared to the basic 4 or 5 type of damages already in the game and their current treatment.  I want to keep it simple, condition appears, might add damage to existing types, or change some bleeding treshold or on screen effects, proper drug is used once, and it goes away. 
These conditions are another layer of flavor/RP. If left untreated, some can even crit patients depending on their severity (a very severe condition would be a stroke happening if you don't take blood thinners and have a history of blood clots or stroke).

8) Having these various conditions and prescriptions would lead to interesting RP with CMO doing rounds for interns?

9) More early round gameplay for doctors and people without meds. 

   ## Newly introduced conditions that have a specific treatment, how to diagnose, how to cure
---------------------------------------
	Arrhythmia (Real life :use a EKG to see the chaotic rhythm. Ingame : Stethoscope already ingame, use to hear irregular and fast heartbeats?): Amiodarone (IV drug)
	Seizure (See a player shaking on the floor) : Midazolam (IV drug)
	Food allergy and airway oedema (character gasps, large skin rash on health check, context of food) : Epinephrin pen
	Acute heart failure (health check will show oedema, and shortness of breath, stethoscope would show crackles) : Furosemide (IV drug), a diuretic = drug that makes you pee and lowers the load on the heart.
	Stroke (Every doctor needs to recognize the 3 signs such as limb weakness, hemianopia or aphasia see above), add reflex hammer to the game that can be used on limbs to show very reactive limbs from the stroke, in case of doubt. Use IV thrombolytics to cure. 

1) This introduces 4 new IV drugs : Midazolam, Furosemide, Thrombolytics, Amiodarone.

2) This adds more uses for the stethoscope.

3) Introduces a hammer reflex that can be used for RP, and to be really sure of a stroke if a patient shows up with just one limb weakness. Hold in one hand and aim on different limbs to use. Will return an emote *the arm shakes normally* or *the arm shakes a lot and multiple times*

## Allergies : 
-------------
Limit to food to begin with, then extend to materials (latex etc. with checks when handling different items, and symptoms involving only skin like rash and pain)

Meals should have a tag containing allergens they has been made with (milk, nuts, wheat etc).

Perform a check with player's allergies when eating the food.

If allergic : pain, diarrhea (shit puddle on the ground? janitor with hazmat gameplay! can be avoided by going to toilets?). Or more severe stuff like airway oedema requiring epinephrin fast, or get asphyxiation damage.

Patients should know their allergies from the customization screen. RP gameplay could be made by going to see the doctor for an allergy certificate for various purposes.
